# PREVENT: Proactive Risk Evaluation and Vigilant Execution of Navigation and Manipulation Tasks for Mobile Robotic Chemists

Mobile robotic chemists are transforming chemistry and materials research by automating lab workflows. However, current systems often lack workflow awareness, making them vulnerable to small anomalies—such as uncapped sample vials—that can disrupt entire processes, waste resources, or even endanger researchers.

**PREVENT** addresses this challenge by introducing a multimodal Behavior Tree (BT) framework that integrates:

-  Dexterous and Navigational Vision systems
-  IoT-based gas sensing for hazard detection
-  AI-based perception modules (CNNs, VLMs)

This repository provides:

- ✅ Source code implementing the multimodal Behavior Tree framework
- 📁 Sample datasets used for training and evaluation
- 🧪 Details of experimental setups and test scenarios used in risk simulations

## Installation and Quick start

Basic setup instructions will be added soon. For now, please refer to the source code and existing scripts in the `BT/` folder.
